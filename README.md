# The Board Social App

As a way to learn Node JS and Express JS over the winter break, I decided to create a social application. I am not an expert when it comes to designing a webpage or using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap so the layout is very basic. The primary focus of this project was to learn how Node operates in the backend of a web application.

# Main Server File

app.js

# Remaining Objectives

I want to try and make a realtime messaging system between two specific users and I want to involve encryption in the signup/login process.
